The agent-based model is presented following the ODD (Overview, Design concepts, and Details) protocol (Grimm et al., 2006, Grimm et al., 2010).

# Model ODD Description
People usually say that there would be a significant increase in sales of electric vehicles only if there were more charging options and less to worry about the cars stopping midway. This model tries to examine the same if there exists a very strong relationship between them or not. The model makes use of data available for the state of California and tries and predicts the sales patterns and charging infrastructure growth while also keeping the track of the interrelationship between them. Following are the sources from which the data required has been collected and other references which have set the base for different patterns used and assumptions.

## 1. Purpose and Patterns 

This model has been developed to simulate the importance of the availability of charging infrastructure for sales growth of electric cars in the US state of California. Initially, the cost of the vehicle and its range was also considered to be included in the scope of the model but were chosen to be omitted as the market price of cars was vague for different capacities with ambiguous after-sales benefits. Additionally, the lack of proper data on the actual requirement of range to be driven by average customers resulted in the exclusion of electric vehicles' range from this model.

The dataset used in this model consists of the rate of sales growth of the different types of electric vehicles and the rate of charging infrastructure available in the US state of California and the corresponding year (2016 - 2021) to which the data belongs to.

By looking at the sales data trends it was assumed that the sales followed a stochastic approach and was therefore implemented using a normal distribution.
The charging infrastructure does seem to have an increasing trend from the data but it has been assumed to fall after some time as the number of infrastructures one can create becomes scarce and also more and more difficult as time progresses. Therefore, the charging infrastructure growth rate has been modelled using a logistic regression.

## 2. Entities, State Variables and Scales

The different agents in this model are described below:
Charging Station: Charging stations are the apparatus used for charging an electric vehicle and are represented as the green patches in the environment. Instead of having the growth rate of the charging stations as a state variable, it has been dealt with differently as a different variable. The rate of growth of the charging infrastructure has been recorded as 'probabilities' which is a list containing all the predicted growth probabilities ('growth-prob' annually) of the charging infrastructure.

The rate of predicted annual sales growth('growth-rates') has also been dealt with as a list namely 'sales-probabilities' which does not relate to the patches or any other entity. 

'Correlations' is the final output list which calculates the correlations between the above two lists. 

Environment: The geographical state of California will be treated as the environment with multiple charging stations as patches and output intended as plots on Interface.

Each tick in the model represents a month passed and the sales and infrastructure growth rates are predicted at the end of 12 months.

## 3. Process overview and scheduling

The model will first import the dataset and then initialize values for sales growth median and standard deviation to calculate the normal distribution of the sales growth. Then, it will set the minimum and maximum charging infrastructure growth rates for the logistic function. After that the model starts with a initial number of charging infrastructure.

As the model begins execution it first checks if a year has passed in the simulation which is equivalent to execution of 12 ticks. If a year has passed then it calls the increase stations module which in turn takes then takes the existing sales growth rate and the charging infra growth rate and calculates the correlation. The first passes of the correlation are initialized as null since the data available is not enough to calculate a proper correlation. After that the necessary output are also updated on the 3 graphs showing the different individual trends. After execution of the sub model, it then calculates the new charging infrastructure annual growth rate and predicts the new sales growth rate for the upcoming simulation.  

## 4. Design Concepts

Basic Principles
The model plans to ascertain the relationship between the electric vehicles' sales with the charging apparatus by looking at the past trends of data and then trying and simulate the same for different values of each other. Looking at the past sales data, it was assumed that the sales pattern was stochastic and henceforth a new value is stochastically calculated as 'growth-rates' and stored into 'sales-probabilities'. The charging apparatus rate was also modelled as a decreasing logistic function throughout the years and each year value is stored in the 'probabilities' list.

Emergence
The sales growth's normal distribution is assumed to follow the past data trend, and is imposed with the mean and the standard deviation of the past data. Also, the maximum and minimum charging infrastructure growth rates are imposed based on the input data.
After the ascertainment of the correlation between them, an emergence will then be realized and stored in 'corr-sales-infra' each year which will illustrate how much does sales get affected by the charging gear. 

This model's final output is going to be the probability of how much sales grow for electronic vehicles based on the change in charging infrastructure. The final output is not just the sum of the aforementioned values but is a list of correlation values which are updated every year and all the output correlation values will be stored in 'correlations' list. The unit of probability will be different from the one used for measuring the sales figures and the number of charging stations. The inputs may hint at the outcome of the model as well and therefore the final output will not be a completely emergent result.

Adaptation
The number of charging infrastructure patches adhere to their growth probability. In the sub model 'update-growth-prob', the number of charging infrastructures is checked every year and the 'growth-prob' is adapted accordingly and new stations are added or if the probability is low then the number stays the same.

Observation Techniques
The model might be observed using multiple different techniques such as the "view" tab where the different graphical elements of the model are updated and their interaction with each other can be examined. Different plots like the "Sales Growth", "Infra Growth", and "Corelation" on the interface tabs have been used to depict the values of the different variables as the model runs. The model also includes behaviour space experiments to further observe and analyse the model's different runs and values.

Prediction
The model will predict the sales growth and charging infrastructure explicitly on the base of the input data each year. As the sales data tends to follow a random trend, the model uses a stochastic approach whereas the charging infrastructure growth rate ideally will decline and henceforth has been predicted as a decreasing logistic function.

Interaction
The two variables sales rate and charging infrastructure are entirely interdependent and are derived from the dataset and therefore will work as individual metrics to help the model make a better decision. 

Stochasticity
A normal distribution has been used for handling the various sales growth parameters namely, 'srate' and 'ssd' which the model ascertains based on the input from data files. Another factor which is the lower rate of growth of the charging infrastructure sales denoted by 'P2' of EV data has used a stochastic approach lower than the minimum of all the growth rates recorded. The model is still being developed and concepts of probability might still need refining in future. 

Observation
The model's output shows that there is not a significant relationship between sales growth and the rate of charging infrastructure growth as the final correlation values are significantly lower and below 0.15 in majority of runs. One of the reasons for this might be the stochastic approach used for the sales growth prediction. Another important factor is the exclusion of the existing personal or workplace charging stations due to which the number of charging infrastructures currently being recorded is not as realistic.

## 5. Initialization

The very first thing that the model would require is the data file without which the sub models would not function. Then, a value can be chosen from the slider for the starting number of charging infrastructure in the world. Additionally, when the data file is recognized, the charging growth rates' maximum and minimum values are initialized as well as the normal distribution for the sales growth is set up.

## 6. Input Data 

The input data file contains the sales numbers for the different years with the annual growth rate calculated as standardized values. Then, the subsequent rows contain the number of charging infrastructure available across the years along with their standardized annual growth rates.

## 7. Submodels 

increase-stations: This sub model takes in the current growth rate of the charging infrastructure and then updates the patches corresponding to the same number. It also updates all the output plots as the model progresses.

update-growth-prob: This sub model is responsible for updating the charging infrastructure growth rate annually in the model. It does so with the help of logistic functions that are set up in subsequent sub model setup-growth-logistic.

update-sales-rate: This sub model is responsible for updating the sales growth rate which takes the mean and standard deviation of all the sales rates input from the dataset.

calculate-annual: This sub model keeps track of the months being passed and runs the necessary sub models as a year passes
